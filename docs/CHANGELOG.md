# changelog

Newest first. Format: `version (Build N) — date — summary`. Each version section captures what shipped relative to the previous version. Builds are a global monotonic counter; see `src/version.js` for the convention.

## v0.1.1 (Build 20) — 2026-04-27

**Github + Vercel readiness.** No engine changes. This build prepares the project for hosting on GitHub and deployment to Vercel.

- Added `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0, copyright Daniel Nelson)
- Added SPDX headers to entry files (`main.js`, `version.js`)
- Added `README.md` for GitHub viewers
- Added `docs/` folder with `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `HANDOFF.md`
- Build counter convention changed: BUILD is now a monotonic global counter that never resets on version bumps. Previous convention reset BUILD to 1 on each version bump; that lost the "how many iterations total" signal.

## v0.1.0a (Build 19) — 2026-04-27

**Four small fixes after first round of testing.**

- Square corner cursor stays diagonal regardless of cell aspect ratio (was: bug where wide rectangles got near-horizontal cursors at the corners). Fix uses sign-based quadrant angle instead of geometric angle.
- Resolution hint formula refactored: per-form `tilesPerDim()` slot on form modules, plus a global 0.5 perceptual softening multiplier. Daniel's calibration test (1080p × square × sliceScale 2 × zoom 1) now reports ~2.1K (was ~3.3K).
- Default export format changed from PNG to JPG (slight compression usually preferred over lossless given the bilinear interpolation already happening in the render).
- Oversized images now throw a clear error pre-upload instead of silently rendering black. The engine pre-checks `gl.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` and reports the actual GPU limit.

## v0.1.0a (Build 18) — 2026-04-26/27

**Engine extraction + Vite project.** The original ~3050-line single-file `kaleidoscope.html` was decomposed into a Vite project with a "wide engine" + forms-registry architecture.

- New project structure: `src/engine/`, `src/engine/forms/`, `src/shell/`, single `src/main.js` entry
- Forms registry pattern: each symmetry form is a self-contained module declaring GLSL fold function, per-form uniforms, polygon builder, spoke rule, controls list, file code, thumbnail, filename suffix
- Shader composed at startup by stitching together every form's contribution
- `state.form` changed from numeric index to string id (e.g. `'radial'`, `'square'`, `'hex'`) — future-proofs against form-order changes
- Build counter introduced: `v0.1.0a · Build 1` shown in diagnostics footer
- No behavior changes — pure refactor

## v0.0.x (Builds 1–17) — through April 2026

**Pre-extraction monolith.** All in a single `kaleidoscope.html` file. Rough mapping of changelog entries to builds (some entries may have spanned multiple iterations):

- v0.0.17 — hex spoke-edge scale fix; resolution hint heuristic dialed back
- v0.0.16 — rotate cursor polish; square cursor decoupling; right-panel max-width raised; divider drag rAF-coalescing; resolution hint introduced
- v0.0.15 — square aspect ratio added; rectangular cells; corner/edge drag for non-uniform vs uniform scale; aspect encoded in filename
- v0.0.14 — direct manipulation syncs slider/scrub display back to state; overlay redraw rAF-coalescing; miniCanvas hidden during divider drag; hit zones reworked
- v0.0.13 — rotate hot zone extended to spoke-adjacent regions on radial wedges; rotate cursor redrawn (filled-triangle arrowheads); polygon stroke brightens in scale/rotate hover
- v0.0.12 — export resolution uncapped from source dims (bounded only by `gl.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`); 8K + max buttons; rotate cursor angle-aware (16 pre-generated SVG variants)
- v0.0.11 — direct manipulation on slice overlay (move/scale/rotate); cursor changes signal mode on mouse; touch-only visible handles
- v0.0.10 — Pointer Lock API for scrub fields; button hierarchy pass (toggle selections recede so Export reads as the only CTA)
- v0.0.9 — scrub fields on all numeric controls; rotation dials retired; explicit Export button; resize-vector lag fixed
- v0.0.8 — mirror sampling formula corrected (was using complement triangular wave); mirror reflection visualizations clipped to image rect
- v0.0.7 — canvas mid-edge → overlay tip convention; mirror reflection visualization in overlay when wedge crosses image bounds
- v0.0.6 — per-form input normalization inside fold functions; default OOB changed to clamp; dashed amber stroke for OOB wedges; compact form picker
- v0.0.5 — wedge-range fix in foldRadial; rotation matrix convention pinned down; imgDiv + transparent overlay canvas to defeat `.main-slot canvas` background rule
- v0.0.4 — shader-based rendering; FBO export; slot abstraction
- v0.0.3 — three forms (radial / square / hex); slice + canvas attributes
